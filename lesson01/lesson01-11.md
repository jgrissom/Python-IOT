#### Instructions
 - Assemble the circuit
 - Pay careful attention to the row & column placement of the components
 - An active buzzer has polarity (like an led), however, resistance is not needed
 - An active buzzer works like an led - when current is applied to it, it will play a sound
 - Create a new python script (buzzer.py) which activates the buzzer only while a button is pressed
 - Modify the main.py boot script to import the buzzer.py script
